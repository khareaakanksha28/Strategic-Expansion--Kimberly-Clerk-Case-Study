# Strategic-Expansion--Kimberly-Clerk-Case-Study
* PROBLEM STATEMENT--
You just graduated and signed on with a large Consumer Packaged Goods manufacturer in the United States. Working in the R&D group, one of your first tasks is to perform a complete geographic assessment to identify locations for up to three new tissue mills and to create an estimate on potential logistics costs from your mill locations to the Top 20 major metropolitan areas
in the Continental US. Given that this is a new market for your company, you have little 1st party data available. Your Sr Director has instructed you to use the US Census Bureau's Decennial Census data as a starting point (https://data.census.gov). You may leverage any additional 3rd party data that you feel supports your analysis.
Given the strategic importance of this decision to the enterprise, it is critical that your analysis be well documented/supported and that you demonstrate a linear/clear narrative that helps C-level leadership get onboard with your recommendations.
